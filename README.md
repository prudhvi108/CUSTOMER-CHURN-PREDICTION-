# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) using Machine Learning classification models.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Identify key factors leading to customer churn.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- **Accuracy:** Achieved ~80% using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

##  Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training and Evaluation  

## Results
- Random Forest performed best with 80% accuracy.
- Visualized key features affecting churn.

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb` – complete Jupyter Notebook
- `images/` – charts and plots
- `README.md` – project overview

## Future Work
- Deploy model as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
